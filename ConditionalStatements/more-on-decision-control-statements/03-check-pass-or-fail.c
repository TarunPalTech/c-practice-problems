// Problem: Write a program to take marks of 5 subjects from the user. Assume marks are given out of 100 and passing marks is 33. Now display whether the candidate passed the examination or failed.

// Description:
// This program takes marks for 5 subjects from the user: Maths, English, Hindi, Science, and Reasoning.
// It first checks whether all the marks are in the valid range (0â€“100).
// If the marks are valid, it then checks if the student has scored at least 33 in each subject.
// If all subjects have marks >= 33, the student is considered passed. Otherwise, the student is failed.
